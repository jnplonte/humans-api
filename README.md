# Humans API

## Instructions:

  1. Create a PHP based REST API based on the functional requirements below
  2. From a fork of this exact same repo, send a link to your work to info@pragmanila.com .(If you dont have a github account, it has to be created)

## Functional Requirements:
  1. The REST API should serve the following routes:
    - `GET /humans` - Retrieve all humans in the database
    - `GET /human/{id}` - Retrieve a single human record by ID
    - `POST /human` - Create a new human record
    - `PUT /human/{id}` - Update a human record by ID
    - `DELETE /human{id}` - Delete a human record by ID
  2. The REST API should be accept and serve data in JSON format
  3. Use the following schema:
    - `id, first_name, last_name`
  4. *Bonus* - Using a javascript framework of your choice, create a simple UI Client and connect to your API

## Rules/Pointers:
  - Although there are a lot of available frameworks that can help you build your API rapidly, for this exam, we want you to build your API from scratch. We want to see your fundamentals.
  - There is no time limit. You can polish the application as you see fit before submitting.
  - Completed exam should be pushed through github on a public repo

## Key Factors to Consider:
  - Clearly written code is a big plus
  - Use best practices and standards to write code
  - We'll be looking at how you commit code.


## API Usage:
  - run `php artisan migrate`
  - for security access token is base_64 encoded url segment sample (/human => aHVtYW4) and  (/humans => aHVtYW5z)
